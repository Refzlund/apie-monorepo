# @api

`@api` is a monorepo that contains several packages for handling a REST API in a functional programmatic manner.

- [`@api/pipe`](./packages/api-pipe) is the driver of the functional programming structure
- [`@api/responses`](./packages/api-responses) contains branded responses and is used in conjunction with the other packages
- [`@api/kit`](./packages/api-kit) is a library for [@sveltejs/kit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/) (aka [SvelteKit](kit.svelte.dev)) that provides type-safety between frontend and backend. (Former [`sveltekit-zero-api`](https://github.com/Refzlund/sveltekit-zero-api))
